Microservices Architecture
=========================

Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where a 
large application is built as a suite of small, independent services, 
each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms,
 often HTTP APIs. Each microservice is focused on a single business capability
  and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Key Characteristics:
- Decentralized data management
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Fault isolation
- Scalability


Diagram of Microservices Architecture:

+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|   User Service    |<---->|  API Gateway      |<---->|   Client (UI)     |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
         |                        |

+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|  Order Service    |      |  Product Service  |      |  Payment Service  |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
         |                        |                        
         v                        v                        
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|  Database(s)      |      |  Message Broker   |      |  External Services|
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+

Legend:
- Each box is a microservice or infrastructure component.
- Services communicate with API Gateway, not directly with each other.
- API Gateway routes requests to appropriate services.
- Databases can be per service (decentralized).

This is a simplified diagram. In real-world systems, there may be more services, shared infrastructure (like service discovery, monitoring, logging), and more complex communication patterns.
